This Hulu clone project is built using Next.js, React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui components. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the project structure and functionality:

Project Structure:
The project follows a typical Next.js structure with the main components in the components folder and pages in the app folder. It uses the new App Router introduced in Next.js 13.

Main Components:

a. Header (components/Header.tsx):

A responsive header with a logo, navigation links, search functionality, and a theme toggle.
Uses the useTheme hook from next-themes for dark/light mode switching.
Implements a collapsible search input.
b. Hero (components/Hero.tsx):

A full-width hero section with a background image, title, description, and a call-to-action button.
Uses an unsplash random image URL for the background.
c. ContentGrid (components/ContentGrid.tsx):

Displays a grid of content items (movies and TV shows).
Uses dummy data for demonstration purposes.
Implements a hover effect to show play and add buttons on each item.
d. ThemeProvider (components/ThemeProvider.tsx):

A wrapper component that provides theme context to the entire application.
Pages:

a. Home Page (app/page.tsx):

Renders the Hero and ContentGrid components.
b. Layout (app/layout.tsx):

The root layout component that wraps all pages.
Includes the ThemeProvider and Header components.
Styling:

Uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with a custom configuration in tailwind.config.ts.
Global styles are defined in app/globals.css.
The project uses a custom color scheme with CSS variables for easy theming.
UI Components:

Utilizes shadcn/ui components, which are based on Radix UI primitives.
Custom UI components are stored in the components/ui folder (not shown in the file list but referenced in the code).
Functionality:

a. Theming:

Supports dark and light modes using next-themes.
Theme toggle is available in the header.
b. Responsive Design:

The layout is responsive, adjusting for different screen sizes.
The header collapses into a more compact form on smaller screens.
c. Content Display:

The ContentGrid component displays a grid of movies and TV shows.
Each item shows additional controls (play and add buttons) on hover.
d. Search:

The header includes a collapsible search input.
Search functionality is not fully implemented but the UI is in place.
e. Navigation:

The header includes navigation links (Movies, TV Shows, My Stuff).
These links are not functional in the current implementation but the structure is in place for future development.
Development Setup:

Uses Next.js with TypeScript.
Configured with ESLint for code linting.
Uses PostCSS for processing CSS.
Build Configuration:

The next.config.js file is set up for static export (output: 'export').
ESLint is configured to ignore during builds for faster build times.
Images are set to be unoptimized, which is typical for static exports.
Package Management:

Uses npm for package management.
Key dependencies include React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and various UI-related packages.
This Hulu clone provides a basic structure for a streaming service frontend. It includes a visually appealing home page with a hero section and a content grid. The theming system allows for easy switching between light and dark modes. While many features (like actual video playback, user authentication, or real data fetching) are not implemented, the structure is in place to easily extend the functionality in the future.

The application is currently running in development mode (npm run dev), which allows for hot reloading and faster development experience. The actual content is static at this point, but the structure is set up to integrate with a backend API for dynamic content in a real-world scenario.
